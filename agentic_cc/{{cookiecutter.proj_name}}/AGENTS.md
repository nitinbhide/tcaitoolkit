# Instructions for Coding Agents for {{cookiecutter.proj_full_name}}

## About {{cookiecutter.proj_full_name}}
{{cookiecutter.description}}

## Working Rules
Read and strictly follow the working rules defined in `.agents/workingrules.md`

## Path Rules
- All paths in this `AGENTS.md` are resolved relative to the directory containing `AGENTS.md`.
- Skill files (SKILL.md) resolve paths relative to their own directory.
- Scripts referenced inside a skill must use SKILL.md file relative paths (e.g., `scripts/resize.py`).
- Skills are self‑contained: scripts should normally live inside the `<skill>/scripts` directory.

## Project Folder Map

Create subfolders as needed when folder is marked with $SUBFOLDERS_AS_NEEDED.
