Interview me relentlessly about every aspect of this document until we reach a shared understanding. Walk down each branch of the design tree, resolving dependencies between decisions one-by-one. For each question, provide your recommended answer.

Ask the questions one at a time.

If a question can be answered by exploring the codebase, explore the codebase instead. Refer the ARCHITECTURE.md , ADR.md and source map wherever possible

If this is source code file (e.g. python, c++, java, typescript, javascript, rust, html etc), then do not ask questions. Tell your that you cannot analyze source code files and quit.
